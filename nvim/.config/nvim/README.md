# Neovim Configuration

This is a personal Neovim configuration that is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. It is built on top of the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager, which provides a simple and efficient way to manage plugins.

## Structure

The configuration is organized into the following directories:

*   `lua/ocean/core`: This directory contains the core configuration files, such as the main `init.lua` file, the `keymaps.lua` file, and the `options.lua` file.
*   `lua/ocean/plugins`: This directory contains the configuration for all the plugins that are installed. Each plugin has its own file, which makes it easy to manage the configuration for each plugin.
*   `lua/ocean/lsp`: This directory contains the configuration for the Language Server Protocol (LSP) client.

## Functionalities

This configuration provides a wide range of functionalities, including:

*   **Plugin management**: The configuration uses the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager to manage plugins.

*   **Syntax highlighting**: The configuration uses the [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) plugin to provide syntax highlighting for a wide range of languages.
*   **Fuzzy finding**: The configuration uses the [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin to provide fuzzy finding for files, buffers, and more.
